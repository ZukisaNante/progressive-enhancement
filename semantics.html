                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
                     <br>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
                     <br>They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. 
                     <br>This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, <em>“Maybe.”</em> 
                     <br>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky.
                     <br>What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, <em>“Maybe.”</em> </p>
                <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. 
                    <br>The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded,<em> “Maybe.” </em>
                    <br>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
                    <br> Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
                <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad 
                    <br> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
